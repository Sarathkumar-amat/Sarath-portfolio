<h2>Science based Tools to reduce stress by huberman, Andrew</h2>
<p>There are countless triggers for stress but only a few basic mechanisms for reducing it. 
    All of them circle back to regulating the so-called autonomic nervous system and the release of adrenaline which occurs both in the brain and the body when we experience stress.
    <ul>
   <li> It can be very useful to divide stress control into two categories: 
    <p>1) Real Time Tools that allow you to push back on the stress immediately, and </p>
    <p>2) Tools to Raise Stress Threshold, which are really about your ability to engage in adaptive decision-making when adrenaline levels are high.
</p>
    <li>Both of these work exceptionally well but they are appropriate for different circumstances. 
        <p>They work the first time and every time because they are grounded in existing physiological mechanisms. </p>
            <p>That said, practicing them can make them more effective. 
                (And of course deliberate cold exposure is generally something that you do away from stress BUT if you’re stressed it can help at those moments as well; 
                most of us just don’t have the option to run off and do an ice/cold bath when we are in a moment of stress.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The image describes the two most effective science supported ways to control stress. If you want more tools and details, I provide those (at zero cost of course) and with an explanation of their research support (in my laboratory and those of others) at Hubermanlab.com; see episodes on Master Stress and on Cold in particular. We also have a free newsletter that summarizes these with protocols. You can sign up at the link in my profile bio.
    </li>
    </ul>
    And of course getting adequate sleep of sufficient quality, making sure you don’t consume excessive caffeine, exercise, quality social connection and nutrition, are all important as well.</p>
